# A customer shall also be able to selectively return a product and ask for a refund. 
# In such a case, the customer will select an already purchased product from his/her order history within 30 days of purchase, 
# provided the product has been delivered. 
# 
# The sales manager will evaluate the refund request and upon receiving the product back to the store will authorize the refund. 
# If a refund is approved, the product will be added back to stock, and the customer must be notified—ideally via email—of the approval and refunded amount. 
# Moreover, if the product was bought during a discount campaign and the customer chooses to return the product after the campaign ends, 
# the refunded amount will be the same as the time of its purchase with the discount applied.
