# 12. The sales managers are responsible for setting the prices of the products. 
# New products added by the product manager should only appear after their prices have been set by a sales manager.
#  Additionally, they shall set a discount on the selected items. 
# When the discount rate and the products are given, 
# the system automatically sets the new price and notify the users, 
# whose wish list includes the discounted product, about the discount. 
# They shall also view all the invoices in a given date range, 
# can print them or save them as PDF files.
# 
#  Last but not least, 
# they shall calculate the revenue and loss/profit in between given dates and view a chart of it. 
# For loss and profit calculations, the product cost can default to 50% of the sale price for convenience, or it can be specified by the product manager when adding the product.

# The sales manager will evaluate the refund request and upon receiving the product back to the store will authorize the refund. 
# If a refund is approved, the product will be added back to stock, and the customer must be notified—ideally via email—of the approval and refunded amount. 
# Moreover, if the product was bought during a discount campaign and the customer chooses to return the product after the campaign ends, 
# the refunded amount will be the same as the time of its purchase with the discount applied.
