the product manager shall view the invoices

SALES MANAGER (IMPLEMENT): Additionally, they shall set a discount on the selected items. When the
discount rate and the products are given, the system automatically sets the new price
and notify the users, whose wish list includes the discounted product, about the
discount. They shall also view all the invoices in a given date range, can print them or
save them as PDF files. Last but not least, they shall calculate the revenue and
loss/profit in between given dates and view a chart of it. For loss and profit calculations,
the product cost can default to 50% of the sale price for convenience, or it can be
specified by the product manager when adding the product.


REFUND (TEST): A customer shall also be able to selectively return a product and ask for a refund. In
such a case, the customer will select an already purchased product from his/her order
history within 30 days of purchase, provided the product has been delivered. The sales
manager will evaluate the refund request and upon receiving the product back to the
store will authorize the refund. If a refund is approved, the product will be added back to
stock, and the customer must be notified—ideally via email—of the approval and
refunded amount. Moreover, if the product was bought during a discount campaign and
the customer chooses to return the product after the campaign ends, the refunded
amount will be the same as the time of its purchase with the discount applied.
